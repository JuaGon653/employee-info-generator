# employee-info-generator

## Description

For my 10th challenge in the coding boot camp, I created an employee information generator that displays employee's information, in a roster form, on a generated HTML file based off the user's inputted answers in the terminal/command line. Using classes like: Employee(Parent), Manager(Subclass of employee), Engineer(Subclass of employee), and Intern(Subclass of employee); I was able to achieve this. Every class will have properties named: name, id, and email. Manager will have it's own property named 'office number,' Engineer will have a 'github' property, and Intern will have a 'school' property. At the beginning of running the application, the user will be prompted with inserting information associated with the manager. At the end of the manager prompts, the user is given a menu that decides whether to add an engineer, intern, or to finish build. Based off the answer of the last question, they can then be prompted for engineer information, intern information, or have the html file generated. Again after answering engineer or intern prompts, the user will be faced with the menu. Functionality in the generated html file that was added was when you click the email of an employee, the user's default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address. And clicking the GitHub username of an engineer redirects you to another tab that loads their GitHub profile page.
